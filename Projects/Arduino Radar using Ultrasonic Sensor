Prerequisites :  Mount the Ultrasonic Sensor on Servo Motor

This project is about using processing to make radar system using ultrasonic sensor. Once the processing code is up and running, you will see the radar interface to detect if any objects appear when ultrasonic sensor is moving.
This project contains both arduino and processing files.
